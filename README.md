## Research Overview
### Goal: Investigating Ocean-Driven Melting in Ice Shelf Basal Channels
Basal channels and crevasses play a critical role in ice shelf evolution by influencing melt rates, circulation patterns, and structural stability. This repository focuses on:
- Large Eddy Simulations (LES) of circulation within ice shelf cavities
- The impact of oceanic boundary conditions on near-boundary melting
- The influence of channel width, far-field temperature, salinity, velocity, and orientation on melt distribution
- The role of Coriolis-driven circulation in basal channel dynamics

### Key Findings:
- Melt rates are highest along channel walls compared to the top of channels.  
- Melt rates are most sensitive to changes in velocity and temperature of the far-field ocean.  
- Variability in ocean conditions drives differing patterns of melt within and outside basal geometries.

## Data Access

This project utilizes Large Eddy Simulations developed with MITgcm, incorporating 3D Smagorinsky viscosity and ice-ocean boundary layer parameterization. 2D Y-average fields for the reference case are available in the `/High Res Output/` folder.
